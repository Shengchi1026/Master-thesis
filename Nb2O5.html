                        Niobium oxide-based materials are regarded as a new type of Li-ion battery anodes due to their high charge/discharge rates. 
                        In the present study, we computationally examine adsorption energy (Eads), activation barrier (Ea), and diffusion coefficient (D) 
                        to systematically resolve the mechanisms in the charge processes at the molecular level. In the Eads calculations, we found that 
                        most of pocket sites (7/13) have higher Eads (> -3.4 eV) than vertical window (3/9) and horizontal window (2/7) sites. 
                        Additionally, pocket-pocket diffusion has the highest Ea (0.59 eV). Those energetic results indicate that Li initially adsorbs 
                        and prefers to stay in the pocket sites during the charge process. On the other hand, Li has the lowest Ea (0.16 eV) in the 
                        horizontal window diffusion. Our Ab initio Molecular Dynamic (AIMD) results also found that diffuse along the b axis has the 
                        greatest diffusion coefficient (4.63 × 10−6 m2 s−1 at 600K). Those results suggested the horizontal window diffusion along b 
                        axis is the preferential pathway for Li transport in the charge processes. Finally, our vibrational computations along with 
                        the operando Raman spectra confirmed those proposed mechanisms.
